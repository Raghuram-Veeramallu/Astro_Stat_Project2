### Software setup to run the notebook

We recommend using a `conda` environment to install the requirements and run the notebook.  

1. Install Conda
Conda can be installed from this page: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html.  

2. Create a conda environment

You can change the name of the environment from `ast5731_group3_project1` to the one you want.

3. Install Jupyter notebook from this page: https://jupyter.org/install  

4. The notebook can be run using by starting the jupyter notebook server
